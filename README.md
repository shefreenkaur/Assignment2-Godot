# COMP 360 Assignment 2 - 3D Glider Flight System

# Glider Flight Simulation : Shefreen, Paramvir, and Sahib

This project simulates the movement of a glider along a circular flight path, with visual dots representing the path. The settings and functionality of the code are explained below.

## 1. Flight Settings

- **`flight_height`**: The height at which the glider flies, fixed at 35 units above the ground.  
  *Note*: Initially set at 20, which caused the glider to collide with the terrain (i.e., the plane passed through the terrain).

- **`circle_radius`**: Defines the radius of the circular flight path, set to 25 units.  
  *Note*: Initially set to 40, which moved the glider out of the terrain. The final setting improves the scene's appearance.

- **`flight_speed`**: Controls how fast the glider moves along the path.  
  *Note*: This setting can be adjusted for different speeds.

## 2. Path Visual Settings

- **`dot_spacing`**: Controls how far apart the dots are along the path, set to 1 unit.  
- **`dot_size`**: Determines the size of each dot, set to 0.12 units.  
- **`path_color`**: The color of the dots along the path, set to a pinkish color.

These settings can be adjusted to modify the visual appearance of the path.

## 3. Main Variables

- **`center_x`**, **`center_z`**: Define the center of the circular path in 3D space (50 units on the X-axis and 70 on the Z-axis).
- **`path`**: A `Path3D` node that holds the curve defining the circular flight path.
- **`path_follow`**: A `PathFollow3D` node that allows the glider to follow the path.
- **`glider`**: The 3D model of the glider, which follows the path.

## 4. Main Functions

### `_ready()`
- Clears any existing paths from the scene.
- Calls `create_circular_path()` to generate the flight path.
- Calls `spawn_glider()` to spawn and position the glider along the path.
- Calls `create_dotted_path()` to generate and place visual dots along the path.
- Stores the initial position of the glider.

### `create_circular_path()`
- Builds the circular path using a `Curve3D`.
- The circle is generated by calculating points at regular angles around the center (`center_x`, `center_z`), at the height of `flight_height`.
- Tangents (directions of movement) are calculated to ensure smooth curves and turns.
- It creates a `PathFollow3D` node that will follow this curve continuously, using the loop option to repeat the path.

### `spawn_glider()`
- Loads the glider model from a scene file (`glider.tscn`), instantiates it, and positions it at the start of the path.
- The glider is positioned and rotated correctly to face forward along the path.
- An extra `Node3D` (`orientation_holder`) is used to manage the glider’s orientation, keeping it aligned with the path’s direction.  
  *Note*: Other attempts to fix the plane using different methods (e.g., drag and drop of `plane.glb`) caused errors, so this approach was finalized after multiple tests.

### `update_glider_movement(delta)`
- Moves the glider along the circular path.
- The `path_follow.progress` is incremented based on `flight_speed` and the time passed (`delta`), allowing the glider to smoothly progress along the path.

### `_physics_process(delta)`
- This built-in function is called every frame.
- It simply calls `update_glider_movement(delta)` to update the glider’s position, ensuring smooth movement.

### `create_dotted_path()`
- Clears any existing visual path dots.
- Calculates the total length of the path and determines how many dots should be placed along it based on `dot_spacing`.
- For each dot, it calculates its position along the curve and creates a new dot (using `create_dot()`).

### `create_dot()`
- Creates a spherical mesh (using `SphereMesh`) to represent each dot along the path.
- The material is set with glowing properties (emission) to make the dots appear as glowing spheres.
- The created dot is added to the scene.

## How the Script Works Together

1. **Circular Path Creation**: At the start of the scene, a circular flight path is generated for the glider to follow. This is based on the parameters (`center_x`, `center_z`, `circle_radius`, `flight_height`).
   
2. **Glider Spawning**: A 3D glider is spawned at the beginning of this path and is aligned to move along it.

3. **Dotted Path**: As the glider flies along the circular path, glowing dots are placed along the path to visualize the glider's route.

4. **Movement**: The glider moves along the path over time, with its speed controlled by the `flight_speed` setting. The path is looped, so the glider keeps flying in a circle indefinitely.

## Notes

- The various settings (`flight_height`, `circle_radius`, `flight_speed`, etc.) can be adjusted to customize the behavior and appearance of the flight simulation.
- The use of `PathFollow3D` ensures smooth, continuous movement along the circular path.
